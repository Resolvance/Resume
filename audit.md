👍 What’s Working Well

First, some of your strengths that stand out:

The technical breadth is impressive: ML, blockchain, embeddings, embedded / electrical, connectivity across stacks.

The real-world / mission-driven experience (naval, nuclear, engineering) gives credibility and sets you apart.

You include specific metrics (e.g. “17,754+ insurance documents”, “741 Sub-TOI classifications”) which help show impact.

You show leadership roles, project ownership, cross-disciplinary work (hardware + software).

You have education / credentials that back up your claims.

These are strong pillars. Now let’s see how to make them shine more cleanly, especially for an online / remote audience.

Areas to Improve & Suggestions

Here are things you can tweak or add to elevate the resume’s effectiveness.

Area	Issue / Weakness	Suggestions / Fixes
Clarity & Readability	The resume is dense; walls of text / bullet items are long. Some things are hard to scan quickly.	Break long bullet points into more sub-bullets. Use consistent verb tense. Keep each bullet to one key idea.
Formatting & Visual Hierarchy	The resume is all plain text, one column. It’s harder to guide the eye.	Use a visual layout: two columns (e.g. tech / skills sidebar + main experience). Use bold / italics sparingly to emphasize roles, projects, outcome. Use more spacing, separators.
Tailoring to Desired Roles	Because you want online / remote work, it’s good to highlight remote collaboration, distributed systems, asynchronous workflows.	Add a “Remote & Distributed Experience” section or call out parts where you worked with remote teams, version control across geographies, etc.
Outcome / Impact Oriented	Many bullets say “what you did” (implemented, built) but less emphasize what improved or resulted.	After describing what you built, add the business / user / performance impact: e.g. “reduced latency by X%,” “cut error rates by Y,” “increased throughput,” “saved $Z in costs.”
Relevance & Prioritization	Some older / less relevant items may distract. The “Co-op Experience” duplicates Kinos Medical etc.	Trim older roles or merge duplicates. Put the most recent, highest-value items first. If a role has low pertinence to your target remote AI work, shorten it.
Skills Section Organization	The skills list is large and somewhat unstructured. It may be unclear which are your strongest, or most relevant for a given role.	Organize skills by categories (e.g. “Languages / Frameworks”, “Database & Infrastructure”, “Hardware & Electrical”, “DevOps / Deployment”, “Other Tools”). Also consider indicating your proficiency level (expert, intermediate) or recency of use.
Projects / Portfolio	You mention big projects under “Project Management Experience,” but you don’t have a separate “Selected Projects / Portfolio” section to showcase side / freelance / personal work (especially relevant for online work).	Add 2–3 side or open source / personal / freelance AI / programming projects, with links (GitHub, live demos). Show full stack, published code, data, or models.
Remote Work / Communication Skills	Online / remote jobs often care a lot about communication, collaboration, self-management.	Add a “Remote / Online Work Skills” bullet: time zone overlap, asynchronous communication, using Slack / Teams / GitHub, documentation, code reviews, etc. Also mention any experience working across continents or time zones.
Certifications / Credentials	You mention “Japanese Proficiency certificate from Drexel,” but not e.g. AI / cloud certs.	If you have any relevant certifications (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, ML courses, Kaggle achievements), include them.
Contact / Links / Branding	You list phone / email / location, but no link to GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site or portfolio.	Add clickable links (GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site) at top. Also consider a short one-line tagline under your name, summarizing your specialization (e.g. “AI / Embedded Systems Engineer
Grammar / Wording Tweaks	A few phrases are awkward / heavy. E.g. “Has held a top-secret clearance in Quality Assurance of Nuclear material, preventive maintenance, direct operational of 2 ship locked Nuclear Reactors…” reads clunky.	Rephrase for clarity: “Held top secret clearance; led QA on nuclear materials; operated two ship-based nuclear reactors…” Also ensure verb tenses match (past vs present) consistently.
International / Remote Employer Sensitivity	You currently show “Higashimatsuyama, Japan” — good — but remote employers might care about timezone overlap, availability, etc.	In a summary or header, briefly mention your work hours, flexibility to adjust to other time zones, ability to travel (if relevant).
Example Mock-up of Header / Top Section

Here’s how you might restructure the top to be more online / remote-friendly:

What to Emphasize for Online / Remote Roles

Because your goal is online / remote engineering, here are things make sure you emphasize:

Autonomous work & self-drive — show that you succeed without constant supervision.

Distributed system / cloud / microservices experience — you already have it (Docker, FastAPI, microservices) — highlight it.

Communication / documentation skills — remote work demands clear writing, documentation, asynchronous workflows.

Version control / CI / testing / deployment — show that you can manage entire code + deployment lifecycles.

Scalable architecture & modularity — remote work often requires writing maintainable, clean, well-documented code that others can pick up.

Open source / community contributions — these help validate your skills publicly.

Time zone / overlap / availability — reassure employers that you can coordinate across time zones.

Prioritization Plan

You don’t need to fix everything at once. Here’s a suggested order:

Add links (GitHub, LinkedIn) and a strong tagline.

Refactor the top summary & header for clarity + remote focus.

Reorganize / categorize skills.

Trim redundant or less relevant roles; bring the most relevant ones forward.

Split long bullets, add impact metrics.

Add a “Selected Projects / Portfolio” section.

Polish formatting — spacing, two columns, visual cues.

Revise grammar / phrasing for tighter writing.

If you like, I can rebuild a polished version of your resume (HTML + styling) tailored for remote AI / engineering roles, then show you a before / after. Do you want me to do that?
